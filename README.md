# AI Text Detector

A powerful tool to analyze and determine if text was written by a human or generated by AI.

## Project Overview

AI Text Detector is a web application built for the Traderly Hackathon by Team JustWork. The tool uses advanced machine learning to analyze text patterns, vocabulary usage, and structural elements to determine whether content was written by a human or generated by AI like ChatGPT, Claude, or similar tools.

## Mockup Version
Weâ€™ve launched a static prototype (no AI functionality) to illustrate the concept.
Explore it here: [Traderly AI Detector](https://tradrly-online-ai-detector.vercel.app/)
 
## Features

- **Instant Text Analysis**: Get quick results on whether text is AI-generated or human-written
- **Multilingual Support**: Works with text in any language through automatic translation
- **Confidence Rating**: Shows the probability percentage and confidence level of the prediction
- **Detailed Analysis**: View text statistics and analysis factors used in the determination
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- **Privacy First**: Text is analyzed securely and not stored permanently

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- Built with Next.js and React
- UI components from shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS styling
- Direct API integration with the backend service

### Backend
- FastAPI framework for high-performance API endpoints
- BERT-based model fine-tuned on a dataset of human and AI-generated text
- Automatic language translation via Google Translator before analysis
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) support for direct frontend communication

## Model Information

The AI detection model is a fine-tuned BERT-base model that was trained on a diverse dataset of human-written and AI-generated texts. The model analyzes patterns, structures, and characteristics that differ between human and AI content.

The model achieves high accuracy by:
- Recognizing repetitive patterns common in AI-generated text
- Analyzing vocabulary diversity and distribution
- Evaluating contextual coherence and semantic variations
- Identifying structural elements characteristic of AI generation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/teamjustwork/ai-detector.git
   cd ai-detector
   ```

2. Set up Python environment
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the backend server
   ```
   python backend.py
   ```
   The backend will run on http://localhost:8000

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
   The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000

## Model Training and Notebooks

The model was trained and fine-tuned using a specialized methodology for AI text detection. You can find the training notebook and explore the model development process here:

- [AI Text Detection Model Training Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1t0bUidcGB4wUnf0sG5vlmEGf5bVWxaDd?usp=sharing)
- And you can download the model through here [Model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YNd-Uq3FIOKvwZoH83ckvjnYvwAYbVGr?usp=sharing)

Alternatively, you can find the notebook in the `backend/notebooks` directory of this repository.

## Multilingual Support

The system supports text analysis in any language. When text is submitted:

1. The language is automatically detected
2. Non-English text is translated to English using Google Translator
3. The translated text is processed by the AI detection model
4. Results are returned with the original and translated text for reference

This translation process happens transparently to the user and allows our model to provide accurate results regardless of the input language.

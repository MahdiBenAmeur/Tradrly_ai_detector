Inside, glowing crystals lit up the walls, and in the center sat an ancient book. The book spoke of a forgotten treasure that could bring great prosperity to the village — but only if found with a pure heart.\\n\\nDetermined, Leo set off on a journey across forests, rivers, and deserts. Along the way, he helped strangers, solved riddles, and resisted temptations. In the end, Leo didn’t find gold or jewels — the real treasure was the friendships he built and the wisdom he gained.\\n\\nWhen he returned home, the village celebrated him not for bringing riches, but for bringing back stories, hope, and courage they had long forgotten.\\n\\nAnd so, Leo’s name lived on, not in legend for wealth, but for kindness\"\n",
